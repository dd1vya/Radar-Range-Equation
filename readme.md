## EVALUATION OF RADAR RANGE USING PYTHON

### Aim:
To calculate the maximum range of a radar system using the Radar Range Equation and verify the results through Scilab programming.

### Theory:
The Radar Range Equation is a fundamental relation used in radar system design to determine the maximum range at which a radar can detect a target. It is expressed as:

### Procedure:
1)Set Up the Scilab Environment:
Open Scilab software and create a new script file (.sce).
2)Define the Input Parameters:
Specify the transmitted power, transmitter and receiver gains, operating frequency, radar cross section, and minimum detectable power.
3)Compute the Wavelength:
Calculate wavelength using the speed of light and operating frequency.
4)Implement the Radar Range Equation:
Use Scilabâ€™s mathematical functions to compute the maximum radar range based on the formula.
5)Execute the Script:
Run the program to obtain and display the maximum radar range.

### Output waveform:


### Manual Calculations: 


### Result:
Thus, the maximum range of a radar system using the Radar Range Equation is calculated and verified through Scilab programming.
