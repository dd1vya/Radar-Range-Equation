## EVALUATION OF RADAR RANGE USING PYTHON

### Aim:
To calculate the maximum range of a radar system using the Radar Range Equation and verify the results through Scilab programming.

### Theory:
The Radar Range Equation is a fundamental relation used in radar system design to determine the maximum range at which a radar can detect a target. It is expressed as:

### Procedure:
1)Set Up the Scilab Environment:  
Open Scilab software and create a new script file (.sce).  
2)Define the Input Parameters:  
Specify the transmitted power, transmitter and receiver gains, operating frequency, radar cross section, and minimum detectable power.  
3)Compute the Wavelength:  
Calculate wavelength using the speed of light and operating frequency.  
4)Implement the Radar Range Equation:  
Use Scilabâ€™s mathematical functions to compute the maximum radar range based on the formula.  
5)Execute the Script:  
Run the program to obtain and display the maximum radar range.  

### Code:
```
Ppeak = 500000;
G = 25118.86;
sigma = 1;
Ae = 32;

Smin = logspace(-12, -6, 100);
Rmax = ((Ppeak * G * sigma * Ae) ./ (16 * %pi^2 .* Smin)).^(1/4);
subplot(3,1,1);
plot(Smin, Rmax);

Ppeaka = linspace(1e5, 1e6, 100);
Rmax2 = ((Ppeaka * G * sigma * Ae) ./ (16 * %pi^2 * 1e-12)).^(1/4);
subplot(3,1,2);
plot(Ppeaka, Rmax2);

Ga = linspace(1e4, 3e4, 100);
Rmax3 = ((Ppeak * Ga * sigma * Ae) ./ (16 * %pi^2 * 1e-12)).^(1/4);
subplot(3,1,3);
plot(Ga, Rmax3);
```
